- Leading strategic initiatives for the MGB’s “Journey to Cloud” migration requirements on Azure DevOps Services and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. Collaborating with business leaders and other solution architects from Digital, InfoSec, Clinical, and PM teams for designing SDLC Projects which include but are not limited to Agile/Scrum process workflows, Git repos strategy and branch policies, pipeline design (including templates), artifact streams, and reporting/analytics dashboards.

- SME on architecting ADO Organization custom process templates (Basic, Agile, Scrum, CMMI) with advanced WI fields/backlogs/states, Extensions, and WI Project rules, for complex SDLC workflows.

- Collaborating with senior developers and solution architects to design ADO YAML (including templates) and Classic Pipelines for deployment to Cloud services (Azure & AWS) and on-prem datacenter targets.

- Developed and deployed Ephemeral ADO Self-Hosted Ubuntu Agents on OpenShift containers for on-demand Pipeline Job runs. Solution was built using Custom Metrics Autoscaler (KEDA) and Docker/Podman. Reduced ADO Agent Pool environment deployment and configuration time by 90% using OpenShift IaC Deployments, Trigger Authentications, and Scaled Jobs YAML objects over ADO YAML Pipeline deployments.

- Providing architectural consultation services for ADO and GHEC integration with external systems and platforms (ServiceNow, Terraform Cloud, dbt cloud, Azure Data Factory). These integrations came in the form of REST API development (authenticating through OAuth 2.0 or service accounts PAT), ADO Extensions for Pipeline Tasks, and/or Service Hooks configuration.

- Developed PowerShell modules and Azure Functions over RESTfull ADO/GHEC APIs to automate the provisioning of custom templated ADO Projects/Teams and GHEC Repos/Teams. Integrated provisioning environment with custom ADO Change Requests for UI access, reducing provisioning time by 95%. This solution also provided consistency in the provisioning services configuration and policies.

- Designed and implemented ADO/GHEC advanced log reporting solution (pulling log data streams from ADO Organizations/Project and GHEC Organizations)  using Service Hooks, Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hub, Azure HTTP-triggered Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Synapse Analytics, and PowerBI Dashboards.
